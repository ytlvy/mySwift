 *  Align a view relative to a sibling view in the same superview.

 *  @param align   The `Align` type used to specify where and how this view is aligned with its sibling.
 *  @param sibling The sibling view this view will be aligned relative to. **NOTE:** Ensure this sibling view shares the same superview as this view, and that the sibling view is not the same as this view, otherwise a `fatalError` is thrown.
 *  @param padding The padding to be applied between this view and the sibling view, which is applied differently depending on the `Align` specified. For example, if aligning `.ToTheRightOfMatchingTop` the padding is used to adjust the x origin of this view so it sits to the right of the sibling view, while the y origin is automatically calculated to match the sibling view.
 *  @param width   The width of the view.
 *  @param height  The height of the view.
